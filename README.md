## Project Description

AFIP Report Viewer is a web application that allows users to view and navigate through financial report files downloaded from AFIP (Argentina's Federal Administration of Public Revenue) with the file name "Reporte". Users can upload their own "Reporte" files to the page, and the application will generate cards with a preview of each file, enabling them to quickly access the content of their financial reports.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and folders:

- `index.html`: The main page of the application that displays the cards with the loaded "Reporte" files.
- `styles.css`: CSS file that defines the appearance and layout of the application.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file that adds interactivity and functionality to the page. (This file was moved from "index.html" to a separate file).
- `server.js`: Server file that handles HTTP requests and serves static files.
- `package.json`: npm configuration file containing information about the project and its dependencies.

## Technologies Used

The project uses the following technologies:

- HTML: The markup language used to create the structure of the web page.
- CSS: The style sheet language used to design and format the appearance of the page.
- JavaScript: The programming language used to add interactivity and functionality to the page.
- Bootstrap: A CSS framework that provides predefined styles and components for a responsive and attractive layout.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment used to execute the server and handle HTTP requests.
- Express: A Node.js framework used to simplify the creation of web servers and handle routes.
